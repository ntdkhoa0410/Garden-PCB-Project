**Background:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello world, as I am new to PCB hardware design, a friend (a senpai) of mine has a garden and is planning to turn his garden into a smart garden, so he gave me requirement design and I will design and make the PCB for him. And I thought it would be a good idea to share my approach, my way of learning of how to be a complete beginner to how to be able to design a PCB full-fledge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginners could view this as a reference for their new journey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For guys with experience, constructive feedback is always welcome. ‘

**Some good materials before we dive in:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some good resources that I mainly use for this project:

1. How to use Altium and learn the PCB design process in general: [This youtube video of Robert Feranec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqFtSpAXB9Q)
2. Places to order, find reliable electrical components: [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/), [Mouser](https://www.mouser.vn/),
3. Tools to quickly download footprint and schematic symbols: [Altium Library Loader](https://www.samacsys.com/library-loader/); [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/)
4. Calculate trace width, via diameter, etc: [SaturnPCB toolkit](https://saturnpcb.com/saturn-pcb-toolkit/)
5. To be updated…

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now finally, we will dive into the project
